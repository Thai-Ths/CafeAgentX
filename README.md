## Overview

**CafeAgentX** is a ready-to-run caf√© assistant built with LangChain and LangGraph. The assistant blends Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a structured SQLite database, and multiple specialized agents to deliver accurate answers about menus, promotions, and reservations.

Unlike a generic ‚Äúframework‚Äù pitch, this repository spotlights a concrete caf√© chatbot implementation that you can clone and use right away. The underlying SupportFlowX scaffolding still powers the orchestration, so you can extend or repurpose it without starting from scratch.

## ‚ú® What CafeAgentX Delivers

- **RAG for caf√© knowledge** ‚Äì Answers grounded in curated documents stored in ChromaDB.
- **SQLite order data** ‚Äì Structured lookups for menu items, pricing, and availability.
- **Plug-in agents** ‚Äì Intake, cafe knowledge, and database experts collaborate via LangGraph; register new agents in minutes.
- **Polished UI** ‚Äì A Gradio chat interface with logs, sample prompts, and Gemini API key input.
- **Production-minded flow** ‚Äì Clear separation between workflow orchestration, agents, and data assets.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Snapshot

The orchestration lives in `workflows/`. `main.py` wires together the agents, builds the LangGraph workflow, and launches the Gradio UI.

- `agents/` ‚Äì Individual agent logic (intake, caf√© knowledge, database, aggregators, etc.).
- `rag/` ‚Äì Document loaders, embeddings, and vector store helpers.
- `database/` ‚Äì SQLite schema plus scripts to refresh caf√© data.
- `config/` ‚Äì Shared settings and agent registry.
- `ui/` ‚Äì Front-end theme, assets, and layout code.

Add or swap agents by registering them in `config/agent_registry.py` and updating the router in `workflows/router.py`.

> **Tip:** Because the workflow is described as a LangGraph state machine, you can observe every intermediate step (state, logs, assigned agents) while you iterate on new capabilities.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
agents/      - Agent logic and wrappers
assets/      - Knowledge base and raw data for RAG
config/      - Configuration files and agent registry
database/    - SQLite DB and scripts
rag/         - RAG system and embeddings
ui/          - Gradio UI and static assets
workflows/   - Workflow graph, router, and shared state
main.py      - Application entry point
```

> **Note:** The Git repository is published as `SupportFlowX`, but the application itself is CafeAgentX. After cloning you are already in the correct project root.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thai-Ths/SupportFlowX.git
cd SupportFlowX  # CafeAgentX project root
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or, for faster installs:
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare data & API key

- Place your caf√© documents for RAG under `assets/knowledge_base/`.
- Ensure `database/database.db` exists (or edit the path in `config/settings.py`).
- Create a [Gemini API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and keep it handy for runtime.

### 4. Rebuild knowledge base and database (optional)

```bash
python rag/rag_system.py       # embed docs into ChromaDB
python database/create_db.py  # create/update database.db
```

Run these whenever you update documents or menu data.

### 5. Launch CafeAgentX

```bash
python main.py
```

Open the local Gradio URL to chat with your caf√© assistant.

## üîß Customizing CafeAgentX

### Add another specialist agent

1. **Create the agent logic** in `agents/your_agent.py`.
   ```python
   from agents.base import BaseAgent

   class LoyaltyAgent(BaseAgent):
       def __init__(self, crm_client):
           self.crm_client = crm_client

       def process(self, state):
           # Inspect state["user_message"] or structured assignments
           # Return a dict containing updates for the workflow state
           return {"logs": ["Loyalty agent responded"], "final_response": "‚Ä¶"}
   ```
2. **Register the agent** in `config/agent_registry.py` so the workflow can instantiate it.
3. **Route traffic** by editing `workflows/router.py` to let the intake agent select the new specialist when relevant.
4. **Chain the node** inside `workflows/graph.py` (pass the callable to `build_workflow`) so it feeds its output to the aggregator.

### Retarget the bot to a different venue

- Swap the caf√© PDFs/notes in `assets/knowledge_base/` for your domain.
- Replace `database/database.db` (or point `config/settings.py` to a new SQLite file) with your structured menu/inventory data.
- Update the copy and imagery in `config/ui_config.py` and `ui/theme.css`.
- Adjust prompts in the agent classes to reflect your terminology.

### Integrate external systems

- Call POS, loyalty, or reservation APIs from the aggregator or specialist agents.
- Publish usage metrics or alerts by appending to the `logs` field in the workflow state.
- Wrap the Gradio blocks in FastAPI/ASGI and serve with `uvicorn` for production.

## üñ•Ô∏è Demo Flow

CafeAgentX coordinates multiple roles:

1. **Intake Agent** interprets the user request and decides which specialists are needed.
2. **Cafe Knowledge Agent (`landscape_cafe_bot`)** performs RAG lookups over curated caf√© documents.
3. **Coffee DB Agent** queries SQLite for structured menu and availability data.
4. **Aggregator** merges responses and returns a single, polished answer.

You can append new agents to this sequence without disturbing the existing collaboration.
