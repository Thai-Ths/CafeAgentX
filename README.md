## Overview

**CafeAgentX** is a ready-to-run café assistant built with LangChain and LangGraph. The assistant blends Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a structured SQLite database, and multiple specialized agents to deliver accurate answers about menus, promotions, and reservations.

Unlike a generic “framework” pitch, this repository spotlights a concrete café chatbot implementation that you can clone and use right away. The underlying SupportFlowX scaffolding still powers the orchestration, so you can extend or repurpose it without starting from scratch.

## ✨ What CafeAgentX Delivers

- **RAG for café knowledge** – Answers grounded in curated documents stored in ChromaDB.
- **SQLite order data** – Structured lookups for menu items, pricing, and availability.
- **Plug-in agents** – Intake, cafe knowledge, and database experts collaborate via LangGraph; register new agents in minutes.
- **Polished UI** – A Gradio chat interface with logs, sample prompts, and Gemini API key input.
- **Production-minded flow** – Clear separation between workflow orchestration, agents, and data assets.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Snapshot

The orchestration lives in `workflows/`. `main.py` wires together the agents, builds the LangGraph workflow, and launches the Gradio UI.

- `agents/` – Individual agent logic (intake, café knowledge, database, aggregators, etc.).
- `rag/` – Document loaders, embeddings, and vector store helpers.
- `database/` – SQLite schema plus scripts to refresh café data.
- `config/` – Shared settings and agent registry.
- `ui/` – Front-end theme, assets, and layout code.

Add or swap agents by registering them in `config/agent_registry.py` and updating the router in `workflows/router.py`.

> **Tip:** Because the workflow is described as a LangGraph state machine, you can observe every intermediate step (state, logs, assigned agents) while you iterate on new capabilities.

> **Note:** The Git repository is published as `SupportFlowX`, but the application itself is CafeAgentX. After cloning you are already in the correct project root.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thai-Ths/SupportFlowX.git
cd SupportFlowX  # CafeAgentX project root
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or, for faster installs:
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare data & API key

- Place your café documents for RAG under `assets/knowledge_base/`.
- Ensure `database/database.db` exists (or edit the path in `config/settings.py`).
- Create a [Gemini API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and keep it handy for runtime.

### 4. Rebuild knowledge base and database (optional)

```bash
python rag/rag_system.py       # embed docs into ChromaDB
python database/create_db.py  # create/update database.db
```

Run these whenever you update documents or menu data.

### 5. Launch CafeAgentX

```bash
python main.py
```

Open the local Gradio URL to chat with your café assistant.

## 🔧 Customizing CafeAgentX

### Add another specialist agent

1. **Create the agent logic** in `agents/your_agent.py`.
   ```python
   from agents.base import BaseAgent

   class LoyaltyAgent(BaseAgent):
       def __init__(self, crm_client):
           self.crm_client = crm_client

       def process(self, state):
           # Inspect state["user_message"] or structured assignments
           # Return a dict containing updates for the workflow state
           return {"logs": ["Loyalty agent responded"], "final_response": "…"}
   ```
2. **Register the agent** in `config/agent_registry.py` so the workflow can instantiate it.
3. **Route traffic** by editing `workflows/router.py` to let the intake agent select the new specialist when relevant.
4. **Chain the node** inside `workflows/graph.py` (pass the callable to `build_workflow`) so it feeds its output to the aggregator.

### Retarget the bot to a different venue

- Swap the café PDFs/notes in `assets/knowledge_base/` for your domain.
- Replace `database/database.db` (or point `config/settings.py` to a new SQLite file) with your structured menu/inventory data.
- Update the copy and imagery in `config/ui_config.py` and `ui/theme.css`.
- Adjust prompts in the agent classes to reflect your terminology.

### Integrate external systems

- Call POS, loyalty, or reservation APIs from the aggregator or specialist agents.
- Publish usage metrics or alerts by appending to the `logs` field in the workflow state.
- Wrap the Gradio blocks in FastAPI/ASGI and serve with `uvicorn` for production.

## 🖥️ Demo Flow

CafeAgentX coordinates multiple roles:

1. **Intake Agent** interprets the user request and decides which specialists are needed.
2. **Cafe Knowledge Agent (`landscape_cafe_bot`)** performs RAG lookups over curated café documents.
3. **Coffee DB Agent** queries SQLite for structured menu and availability data.
4. **Aggregator** merges responses and returns a single, polished answer.

You can append new agents to this sequence without disturbing the existing collaboration.
