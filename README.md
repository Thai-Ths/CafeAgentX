# SupportFlowX üöÄ  
*Agent Orchestration Framework for Scalable, Modular Chatbots*

> **Example Project:** CafeAgentX ‚òï ‚Äì Caf√© Assistant Demo

---

## Overview

**SupportFlowX** is a flexible, agentic orchestration framework designed to build scalable, multi-agent AI assistants.  
The core design enables easy integration, scaling, and replacement of domain-specific AI agents for any business scenario.  
By orchestrating tasks between specialized agents, SupportFlowX minimizes bottlenecks and maximizes both reliability and maintainability.

**CafeAgentX** is provided as a working demo ‚Äî a caf√© chatbot that showcases agent collaboration for customer Q&A, menu, promotions, and database support.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Orchestration-First:** True agentic routing; intake agent delegates tasks to skill-specific agents.
- **Highly Scalable:** Add or swap agents and domains with minimal code changes.
- **Reduce LLM Bottlenecks:** Parallel and specialized task handling for better throughput.
- **Production-Ready Demo:** Caf√© Assistant (CafeAgentX) demonstrates end-to-end deployment.
- **Gradio UI:** Easy, ready-to-use chat interface for fast prototyping or real-world service.

## üí° Use Cases

SupportFlowX is not limited to caf√©s!
- Customer support (retail, banking, IT helpdesk, etc.)
- Booking & reservations
- HR or internal knowledge bots
- Medical, law, or domain-specific assistants
- ‚Ä¶ any scenario where orchestrated, scalable agents make sense.

**Just swap out the agent modules and data!**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **IntakeAgent**: Entry point, receives user input, and decides which agents to route tasks to.
- **Domain Agents**: (e.g., CafeBot, DatabaseAgent) Handle knowledge retrieval, database operations, or external service calls.
- **AggregatorAgent**: (Optional) Merges or post-processes multi-agent outputs.
- **Orchestration Engine**: Built on LangGraph StateGraph, flexibly routes requests per business logic.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/supportflowx.git
cd supportflowx
````

### 2. Install dependencies

#### With pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Or with uv (faster installs/locking)

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare data & API key

* Place your knowledge base (RAG documents) in `/knowledge-base`
* Place your sample DB as `/data/database.db` (or as configured)
* Place images in `/image/`
* **Get a Gemini API Key**: [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) (for Google Generative AI access)

### 4. Run the Demo App

```bash
python core.py
```

Then open the local Gradio UI in your browser!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Scaling

* **Add new skills:** Create new agent modules (see AGXX\_\*.py), import and register in `core.py`.
* **Change business logic:** Tweak agent routing and orchestration logic as needed.
* **Swap domains:** Replace Caf√© agents and data with your own (e.g. legal, retail, travel, etc.)
* **Production Deployment:** Wrap in FastAPI/ASGI and run with `uvicorn` for robust serving.
