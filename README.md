## Overview

**SupportFlowX** is a flexible, agentic orchestration framework‚Äîbuilt on LangGraph‚Äîdesigned to build scalable, multi-agent AI assistants.  
The core design enables easy integration, scaling, and replacement of domain-specific AI agents for any business scenario.  
By orchestrating tasks between specialized agents, SupportFlowX minimizes bottlenecks and maximizes both reliability and maintainability.

**CafeAgentX** is provided as a working demo ‚Äî a caf√© chatbot that showcases agent collaboration for customer Q&A, menu, promotions, and database support.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Orchestration-First:** True agentic routing; intake agent delegates tasks to skill-specific agents.
- **Highly Scalable:** Add or swap agents and domains with minimal code changes.
- **Reduce LLM Bottlenecks:** Parallel and specialized task handling for better throughput.
- **Production-Ready Demo:** Caf√© Assistant (CafeAgentX) demonstrates end-to-end deployment.
- **Gradio UI:** Easy, ready-to-use chat interface for fast prototyping or real-world service.

---

## üí° Use Cases

SupportFlowX is not limited to caf√©s!
- Customer support (retail, banking, IT helpdesk, etc.)
- Booking & reservations
- HR or internal knowledge bots
- Medical, law, or domain-specific assistants
- ‚Ä¶ any scenario where orchestrated, scalable agents make sense.

**Just swap out the agent modules and data!**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The main entry point is `main.py`, which builds the workflow and launches the chat UI.
- Configuration lives in `config/`.
- Database files are stored under `database/` and the knowledge base lives in `assets/knowledge_base/`.
- Each agent is modular and extensible (see the files in `agents/`).

## Project Structure

```

agents/      - Agent logic and wrappers
assets/      - Knowledge base and raw data
config/      - Configuration files and agent registry
database/    - SQLite DB and scripts
rag/         - RAG system and embeddings
ui/          - Gradio UI and static assets
workflows/   - Workflow graph and state router
main.py      - Application entry point

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/supportflowx.git
cd supportflowx
````

### 2. Install dependencies

#### With pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Or with uv (faster installs/locking)

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare data & API key

* Place your knowledge base (RAG documents) in `assets/knowledge_base`
* Place your sample DB as `database/database.db` (or as configured)
* **Get a Gemini API Key**: [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) (for Google Generative AI access)

### 4. Run the Demo App

```bash
python main.py
```

Then open the local Gradio UI in your browser!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Scaling

* **Add new skills:** Create new agent modules in `agents/` and register them in `config/agent_registry.py`.
* **Change business logic:** Tweak agent routing and orchestration logic as needed.
* **Swap domains:** Replace Caf√© agents and data with your own (e.g. legal, retail, travel, etc.)
* **Production Deployment:** Wrap in FastAPI/ASGI and run with `uvicorn` for robust serving.
